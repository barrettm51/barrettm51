## Hi, I'm Barrett Nelson ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a Full-Stack Software engineer looking for opportunities at a high growth startup.** 

#### My Journey 
  In 2021, I quit my job as a design/build construction project manager and decided to become a software engineer. I had a mixed relationship with my job as a project manager. On one hand, I really enjoyed the design side of the job. I led a team of architects and engineers that was tasked with creating building designs that were aligned with the client's vision as well as construction codes and industry best practices. I worked on designs for building types ranging from wineries to industrial process facilities. My headaches with the job came up on the construction side of the job, which entailed managing anywhere between 20-40 independent contractors on a given job. Too often, my day to day consisted of arguing with contractors over quality issues, missed deadlines and cost overruns. I realized that this was not a symptom specifically of the company I was working at (which had great leadership and a fun culture), but of the construction industry as a whole. I realized that construction was not for me, and my strength was in solving complex, technical problems. 
   The tech industry, and specifically software, attracted me because of the sheer volume and velocity of innovation in the space. I started to learn some Javascript on Codecademy and found that I really enjoyed it- it activated the logical problem solving part of my brain that had always been one of my strengths. Having studied electrical engineering in college, I had written some code before and had even built a couple basic HTML websites. But I soon learned that the breadth of knowledge required to be a full-stack software engineer and build interactive web apps goes far beyond writing a Python script or creating some HTML files. I knew I had a long way to go. I enrolled in Codecademy's Full Stack Software Engineer course and never looked back. It has been one of the hardest undertakings of my life, not just because of the technical learning involved but also because I have had to hold myself accountable for my learning and set my own deadlines. Learning to code on your own is not easy, but it has been extremely rewarding for me. 
   On my journey I have learned to code starting with the front end and moving to the back-end. I focused a lot of effort into learning React, because it is such a powerful framework that is used widely in the industry right now....
